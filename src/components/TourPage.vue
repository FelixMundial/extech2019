The spot enjoys a sightseeing history of more than 1000 years due to its picturesque scenery of strangely shape crags, unique caves and beautiful lakes. Within the spot, the cliff inscription since Tang dynasty (known as â€œPoems Corridor of a Thousand Years) provides the tourists a good chance for cultural exploration of the art of inscription calligraphy and Chinese poems. Based on the islands and pools in the spot, Xinghu Wetland Park was built in 2004 and has been developed an important ecological preservation area for wildlife.
